      <p>Sometimes we’ll offer rewards for things like inviting friends to join Salmo. We can withdraw or change these offers any time, without letting you know in advance. You’ll only get financial awards once per action (for example you’ll only get a bonus for once per friend you invite). You might have to pay income tax on money you get as part of these rewards. Contact HMRC if you’re unsure.</p>

        <li>you purposefully didn’t keep your account details safe, or you were very negligent in not keeping them safe or if your account is in overdraft, you gave them to someone else</li>

      <h1>Making changes to this agreement</h1>
      <p>This agreement will always be available in the app and on our website.</p>

      <p class="margin">We can make changes to our charges or the terms of this agreement from time to time. This includes introducing new charges or rates and charging in a different way. We may make these changes, including fees we charge, because of changes to:</p>

      <ul class="margin">
        <li>law, regulation, industry codes, court or regulator decisions</li>
        <li>the way we run our business</li>
        <li>the cost of providing your account and running our business, for example a change in our cost of funding, technology (including our systems) and service costs</li>
        <li>the visa application system</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="margin">We can make favourable changes to these terms and charges for any reason. We can also make proportionate changes for any other balanced and valid reason that impacts Salmo or your account.</p>

      <p class="margin">If we make changes to it that are clearly in your favour, we’ll tell you once we’ve made them. Otherwise we’ll give you two months’ notice and tell you our reasons in the most secure way, using one of our usual channels (see ‘How we’ll contact you’ above).</p>

      <p class="margin">If you don’t agree to these changes, you can let us know and we’ll close your account with no fee. We’ll delete any personal information and record in 1 working day. If we don’t hear from you before the changes come into effect, we’ll assume that you’re happy and accept the changes we’ve made.</p>
